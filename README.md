this is an internal project for me, so mind the mess lmao

if you actually wanna use this, install socket.io-client for node, and the neocities gem for ruby    
then replace the link to my neocities with yours in `./upload.sh` and my channel with yours in `./cytube.js`, and replace my username with yours in `./cytube.js` and place your password in /tmp/pw

this is mainly meant as a guide for someone to make a better version of this. i'd really recommend not using it as is unless you're desperate
